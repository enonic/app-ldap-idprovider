The user authentication is done against an LDAP server and the user information cached locally.

1. In the admin tool "Applications" of your Enonic XP installation, click on "Install". 
2. Select the tab "Enonic Market", find "LDAP ID Provider", and click on the link "Install".

### Step 2: Create and configure the user store
1. In the admin tool "Users", click on "New".

### Step 3: Create and configure the user store

(See [Virtual Host Configuration](http://xp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operations/configuration.html#configuration-vhost) for more information).

    ```ini
    enabled=true
      
    mapping.admin.host = localhost
    mapping.admin.source = /admin
    mapping.admin.target = /admin
    mapping.admin.userStore = system
    
    mapping.mysite.host = localhost
    mapping.mysite.source = /
    mapping.mysite.target = /portal/master/mysite
    mapping.mysite.userStore = myuserstore
    ```
